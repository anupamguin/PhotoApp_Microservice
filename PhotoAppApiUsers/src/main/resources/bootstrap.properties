# bootstrap.properties -->

# this properties file loaded before the application.properties file is loaded and 
# it will be loaded even before the Java beans are created during the application startup.


# but In newer versions , we can skip creating bootstrap.properties and simply add the following property 
# to the application.properties
		
		## spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8011
		
	# where localhost:8011 is a domain and port on which config server is running
	
# as we know newer version we don't need to create bootstrap.properties file but as per udemy tutorial 
# I still create it

#spring.cloud.config.uri=http://localhost:8011
#spring.cloud.config.name=PhotoAppConfigServer
# above PhotoAppConfigServer name exactly same as config server microservice name in application.properties
